This example is the only synthetic data set in the tutorial.
It is the hypothetic burial mound presented by Günther et al. (2006), the original BERT paper.
It comprises 9 profiles in x direction and 13 profiles in y direction with a modifies dipole-dipole array.
The synthetic data are contaminated with noise, i.e. they should be fitted with chi^2=1.
